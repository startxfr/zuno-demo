# mcp

Applies `gitops/apps/mcp` (`gitops/charts/mcp-gateway`): the central MCP
Gateway (ADR-0010) that authorizes every tool call against
`policies/tools/tool-policy.yaml` (ADR-0011) before proxying to a
downstream MCP server (`components/mcp-gateway`). A Day 1 component
(ADR-0056) with a documented no-op `install.yml` - no operator dependency
of its own.
