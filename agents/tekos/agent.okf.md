    notes: >-
      Public vendor/product documentation and general technical Q&A are C1
      (SaaS model use allowed). Answers that incorporate Confluence content
      must respect Confluence's C2 classification (policies/data-classification)
      for the portions of context drawn from it, even though the task's
      ceiling here is C1. The concrete model catalog lives in
      platform/ai-gateway/provider-routing.yaml (not a model name here by
      design); this agent's answer-technical-question preference
      ([local-gpt-oss, local]) lives in
      policies/model-routing/model-routing-policy.yaml — the resolved
      effective chain is generated below in "Model routing".

# Tekos

Technical consultant assistant. Tekos is the only agent with `status:
active` for v0 (MEMORY.md section 9, docs/agents/tekos.md): it is the
first vertical slice and validates frontend, BFF, Keycloak, runtime, AI
gateway, RAG, MCP Confluence, model routing, streaming and citations end
to end.

Conforms to `platform/okf/schema/zuno-okf-v0.2.schema.json` (ADR-0005,
ADR-0006, ADR-0038). Task detail lives in `tasks/*.md`, linked by name from
`zuno.tasks` above; the system prompt for the primary task lives in
`prompts/answer-technical-question.md`.

`zuno.graph_shape: retrieve_reason_respond` (ADR-0342) names the LangGraph
workflow module (`components/agent-runtime/app/graph/shapes/`) Agent
Runtime's `GraphFactory` resolves for Tekos's chat turns - retrieve, an
optional live tool call, reason, respond. Naming it declaratively here (no
prior behavior change) is what lets a later agent reuse this exact shape,
or Arkos declare a materially different one, without any Agent Runtime
code change.

Tekos has no agent-level `zuno.allowed_knowledge` field (ADR-0203): like its
tool ceiling, its knowledge-domain ceiling is derived as the union of every
task's own `zuno.allowed_knowledge`
(`components/agent-runtime/app/registry.py:AgentDefinition.declared_knowledge()`,
mirroring `declared_tools()`) rather than declared separately here - today
that union is `[knowledge.tech]`, from `tasks/answer-technical-question.md`
and `tasks/find-relevant-docs.md`.

## Authorization matrix

Generated per ADR-0503 from this bundle's frontmatter, `policies/tools/tool-policy.yaml`, `policies/knowledge/knowledge-policy.yaml`, `platform/ai-gateway/provider-routing.yaml` and `policies/model-routing/model-routing-policy.yaml` — the enforced intersection (ADR-0011/ADR-0203) restated for review, never read at runtime. Entitlement (ADR-0040): `agent_tekos`; model classification ceiling (ADR-0021): `C1`; status: `active`.

### Model routing

Effective per-task model chain (ADR-0021/ADR-0303/ADR-0412), resolved from `platform/ai-gateway/provider-routing.yaml`'s classification eligibility reordered by this `(agent, task)`'s `policies/model-routing/model-routing-policy.yaml` preference — the first entry is the reference model, the rest are fallback alternatives, in try order.

| Task | Classification ceiling | Reference model | Fallback chain | Adapter | Policy source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `answer-technical-question` (primary; prompt: `prompts/answer-technical-question.md`) | `C1` | `local-gpt-oss` | `local`, `ovhcloud-gpt-oss-120b`, `openai`, `gemini`, `anthropic`, `mistral`, `mistral-codestral` | — | `policies/model-routing/model-routing-policy.yaml` |
| `find-relevant-docs` | `C1` | `local` | `local-gpt-oss`, `ovhcloud-gpt-oss-120b`, `openai`, `gemini`, `anthropic`, `mistral`, `mistral-codestral` | — | `policies/model-routing/model-routing-policy.yaml` |
| `check-my-drive-docs` | `C1` | `local` | `local-gpt-oss`, `ovhcloud-gpt-oss-120b`, `openai`, `gemini`, `anthropic`, `mistral`, `mistral-codestral` | — | `policies/model-routing/model-routing-policy.yaml` |

**Available models** (ADR-0419, generated): the union of every model reachable by any task or prompt slot above, at any classification - `local`, `local-gpt-oss`, `openai`, `gemini`, `anthropic`, `mistral`, `mistral-codestral`, `ovhcloud-gpt-oss-120b`.
